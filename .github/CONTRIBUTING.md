# Contribution Guide

Instructions for contributing to this project.

## Reporting bugs

There are two ways to do it:
- [Create new issue](https://github.com/lc-studios-mc/scp-dystopia/issues/new/choose) (preferred)
- Post in [this forum](https://discord.com/channels/791992574239965185/1254951702247772281) with the tag "Bug report"

If you can, please create new issue because that's more dedicated to track software bugs.

## Feature suggestion

**Please do not create new issue for this.**

Instead, post in [this forum](https://discord.com/channels/791992574239965185/1254951702247772281) with the tag "Suggestion".

You will be listed in credits if your idea is accepted!

## Offering Assets

"Asset" refers to things like:
- Images (textures)
- 3D models
- Animations
- Sound files

You can send us an asset through:
- Discord
  - DM me or ping me in my [Discord server](https://discord.gg/K2mxsJ2trE)
  - My user ID is `luckedcoronet45`
- Email
  - info@lc-studios.net

Only do this if you are okay with these rules:
- Assets will not be your property.
- Assets will be open to anyone.

You will be listed in credits if the asset(s) are being used!
