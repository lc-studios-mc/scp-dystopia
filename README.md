## Context

SCP: Dystopia addon "v2" is a remake.
I'm rebuilding because the v1 (2021~2023) has been obliterated by recent Minecraft updates.

Actually, this is my second attempt to remake it.
First attempt was few years ago: https://mcpedl.com/scp-dystopia-redefined/

Now, this one (the *second attempt* you're looking at right now) was suppoed to be focusing on simply making the old features,
and that's why I named it "v2".

**I've lost quite some development velocity on this one**. This is what happened:
1. I added many new features.
2. Maintenance of new features took precedence.
3. Some parts of new features got messy and outdated.
4. <ins>Taking so long to upgrade "outdated new features", which I still haven't finished it yet.</ins>

I'm very much annoyed by what I stated above, all of this and still in alpha development stage. :sob:

## What will happen

I decided to leave this repository for now, and move on to a [separate repository](https://github.com/lc-studios-mc/scp-dystopia-v1-restoration) for a clearer goal: **Restoration.**

Note that the separate repository will not contain "new features" that this repository have, such as CCTV, Lockdown, etc.
But I'd like to add them back once the restoration part is 90% done.

<ins>This repository will be used again when I'm ready to merge the restored features.</ins>

## Lastly

I'm sorry for taking so long. I hope you understand that frequent direction changes can be common in alpha development stage.

Thanks for reading, and thanks for your support!
