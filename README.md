> [!NOTE]
> Recently, I have restructured this repository, and finally wrote [contribution guides](./.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## :warning: Project Status

<ins>Version 2.0.0 (full rework) is under development!</ins>

You can see our progress in [development branch](https://github.com/lc-studios-mc/scp-dystopia/tree/develop).

Older versions (prior to 2.0.0) do not work well on modern Minecraft versions, and they are no longer supported.

## :inbox_tray: Installation

1. Download add-on file (`.mcaddon`).
1. Open the downloaded file in Minecraft.
1. Minecraft should automatically import the add-on.

If you fail on step 2 or 3, try installing manually:

1. Download add-on file (`.zip`).
1. Extract the downloaded zip file.
1. Move the behavior pack folder named *SCPDY_BP* into `.../com.mojang/behavior_packs`
1. Move the resource pack folder named *SCPDY_RP* into `.../com.mojang/resource_packs`
1. Packs should be installed.

The location of `com.mojang` folder differs in each platform.

On Windows OS, they are located under:

```
{USER HOME}\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.MinecraftUWP_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\games
```

**Some devices do not allow you to do this.**
In that case, please find other workaround. I don't know how.
