## Important Notice

__I'm temporarily moving to [separate repo](https://github.com/lc-studios-mc/scp-dystopia-v1-restoration)
where we mainly focus on restoring old features from v1.8.__

It's because the current codebase (this repo) is not in a healthy state.
I'm unable to develop comfortably.

<ins>After the work is mostly done in that separate repo,
I'll come back to this repo to merge those changes.</ins>
