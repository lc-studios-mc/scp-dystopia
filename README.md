## Context

SCP: Dystopia addon "v2" is a remake.
We're rebuilding because the v1 (2021~2023) has been obliterated by recent Minecraft updates.

Actually, this is our second attempt to remake it.
First attempt was few years ago: https://mcpedl.com/scp-dystopia-redefined/

Now, this one (the second attempt you're looking at right now) was suppoed to be focusing on simply making the old features,
and that's why I named it "v2".

**We've lost quite some development velocity on this one**. This is what happened:
1. We added many new features.
2. Maintenance of new features took precedence.
3. Some parts of new features got messy and outdated.
4. <ins>Taking so long to upgrade "outdated new features", which we still haven't finished it yet.</ins>

We are very much annoyed by what I stated above, all of this and still in alpha development stage. :sob:

## What will happen

We decided to mark this repository as legacy, and move on to the [new repository](https://github.com/lc-studios-mc/scp-dystopia-v1-restoration) for a clearer goal: **Restoration.**

Note that the new repository will not contain "new features" that this repository had, such as CCTV, Lockdown, etc.
